# ToDos application walk-through

The GTUG App Engine Bootcamp tutorial is based on Ron Reiter's [webapp-boilerplate]
which was a derivative of Thomas Davis's [Backbone Tutorials] and Jérôme Gravel-Niquet's
[localtodos].

Ron wrote a walkthrough of his application [here][webapp-boilerplate-walkthrough].
